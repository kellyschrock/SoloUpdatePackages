This version, dated 9/23/2019, is the same version that ships with the Open Solve 4dev installer. So this is pretty musch useless. If you're wondering if you need this, the answer is no.

This is only the ArduCopter firmware for the cube.  This package to facilitate future firmware upgrades for ArduCopter only.  This has no impact on the rest of the Solo or controller's firmware. ArduCopter 4-dev firmware requires you have already installed Open Solo 4-dev.

NOTE: This will execute a parameter reset upon installation. You will need to redo your calibrations and vehicle settings.
