ArduCopter 3.7-Dev Slew Rate Limiting Test
(December 7, 2018 / MCL)

*** FOR BETA TESTING ON ANY SOLO ***
*** Primarily for stock cubes, but will work on Greens ***

This package contains ArduCopter Master 3.7-Dev firmware with patches for slew rate limiting to protect a stock solo from the ESC issue.  This is for early user beta testing.  It is not perfect and may require additional PID tuning.  You are a test pilot.

Also included are several updated python files that will install on the IMX companion computer.  These files are needed to make use of the newer flight modes that didn't exist when the files were last updated.  They also add compatibility for many ArduPilot firmware loading changes.

You should also install the ArduCopter 3.6+ controller update package if you haven't already.  This will update the controller to make it compatible with ArduCopter 3.6.  All controller changes are backwards compatible with prior Open Solo and ArduCopter versions.  This fixes the altitude display, and makes it properly display the new flight modes.

Installation Basic Instructions:
1. Press the Install button below. Firmware will be copied to the Solo.
2. When prompted, power cycle the Solo.
3. Firmware will begin install on reboot.
4. When complete, Solo will beep several times.
5. Solo and controller will reconnect when complete.

After you complete this installation, you do a parameter reset. The following are the general steps:
1. Parameter reset and reboot
2. Install HERE compass parameters if you have that mod, and reboot again
3. Level calibration and reboot.
4. Compass calibration and reboot.

A few things to be aware of:
- If install process doesn't complete after 5 minutes, power cycle Solo.
- A few people have had to power cycle 2-3 times. This is ok.
- If solo & controller don't reconnect when done, power cycle both.
