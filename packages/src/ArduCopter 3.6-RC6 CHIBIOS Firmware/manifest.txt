(July 29, 2018 / MCL)

**CHIBIOS RTOS BETA for Green Cube only! You are a test pilot!!!**

NOTE:
- Motor arm LEDs will be all green (No driver yet.)
- No compass calibration tones (bug)
- No power-off tones yet
- Gimbal twich once in a while (unknown)


** This is not compatible with a stock Solo Pixhawk 2.0! **

This package contains beta testing ArduCopter 3.6-RC6 with the new ChibiOS RTOS, which replaces the older NUTTX RTOS. firmware for the Solo's Pixhawk 2.1 Green Cube, with the Solo's required default parameters built in. Since parameter defaults are built in, when you do a parameter reset, it will put them back to the correct defaults.

Installation Basic Instructions:
1. Press the Install button below. Firmware will be copied to the Solo.
2. When prompted, power cycle the Solo.
3. Firmware will begin install on reboot.
4. When complete, Solo will beep several times.
5. Solo and controller will reconnect when complete.

It is strongly recommended that after you complete this installation, you do a parameter reset. The following are the general steps:
1. Parameter reset and reboot
2. Install HERE or landing gear parameters if applicable and reboot.
3. Level calibration and reboot.
4. Compass calibration and reboot.

A few things to be aware of:
- If install process doesn't complete after 5 minutes, power cycle Solo.
- A few people have had to power cycle 2-3 times. This is ok.
- If solo & controller don't reconnect when done, power cycle both.
