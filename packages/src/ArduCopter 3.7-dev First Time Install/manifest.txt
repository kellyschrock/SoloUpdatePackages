ArduCopter 3.7-Dev Testing
(August 25, 2019 / MCL)

** Compatible with stock cubes, black cubes, and green cubes **
** REQUIRES OPEN SOLO ALREADY INSTALLED **

This package contains ArduCopter Master 3.7-Dev firmware as of August 25,2019, which now officially includes all required compatibility for the Solo. This is for early user beta testing.  You are a test pilot.

Also included are several updated python files that will install on the IMX companion computer.  These files are needed to make use of the newer flight modes that didn't exist when the files were last updated.  They also add compatibility for many ArduPilot firmware loading changes.

You must also install the ArduCopter 3.6/3.7 controller update package if you haven't already.  This will update the controller to make it compatible with recent changes in ArduCopter 3.6 and 3.7.  All controller changes are backwards compatible with prior Open Solo and ArduCopter versions.  This fixes the altitude display, and makes it properly display the new flight modes.

NOTE: This will execute a parameter reset upon installation. This is to ensure numerous parameter defaults are properly set. These are important settings that must be changed to these new defaults and a reset is the best way to ensure it happens for everyone. You will need to redo your calibrations and vehicle settings.

YOU MUST READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE GITHUB SITE BEFORE INSTALLING!
